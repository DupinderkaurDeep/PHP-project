          <p>A website footer is the section that appears at the bottom of every single page of your site. It typically includes important features like a copyright notice, an email capture, or links to resources.<br>

          The footer is a valuable piece of real estate on your site. Why? Because it provides an opportunity to connect with visitors one last time and encourage them to continue to engage with your website<br>
                
          Even site visitors who carefully read a page’s full content might reach the end of an article and close the page. To keep this from happening, you can offer a way for readers to discover additional content — like FAQs, popular blog posts, contact information, and return policies — at the bottom of the page.
                <br>Plus, it’s a seamless way to include required information — like legal disclaimers and privacy policies — on every page.<br>Copyright © PHP website 2023
